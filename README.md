🚗 Car Rental System (Java)
📌 Project Overview

The Car Rental System is a Java-based application designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It allows users to manage cars, customers, and rental operations while demonstrating key Java concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and collections.

The system also includes a login module with password masking and limited login attempts for basic security.

🎯 Objectives

Apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java

Demonstrate class interaction and encapsulation

Implement a simple login system with authentication

Practice writing well-documented and readable code

Simulate real-world car rental operations

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Java Version: JDK 8 or higher
