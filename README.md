# Java Login System

This project implements a simple **Java-based login system** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
The system authenticates a user using a username and password, masks password input during entry, and allows a maximum of **three (3) login attempts**.

The project was developed using **Apache NetBeans IDE** and is intended to demonstrate basic Java programming, control structures, and input handling.
